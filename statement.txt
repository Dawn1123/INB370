Known Bugs
-

Incomplete features
- The graphing for the GUI is incomplete and only displays the log


The main method of the GUI class is located in the GUISimulator class file inside the asgn2Simulators package. There is a run.bat file provided which needs Java and JRE 1.7 installed to run unless a path is declared in the file.
